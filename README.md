# real-time-code-chat
A realtime code chat application, currently under development

## What is different right now than the other Code Editor?
You know those super long URL that app created in order to save code. Well those are know
gone in this version. This currently demostrates something like a URL shortner for code.
Thanks to Microsoft Azure for making that possible right now.

## What about that chat?
Well, it is broken. Not a lot has been implemented because of the learning curve into Microsoft
Azure was unexpectedly large, partly because of so many unhelpful error messages.

## What is this designed for?
This is designed for groups of people to get together to write code collarabitively for short periods of time, like up to a day.
An app may be released for this version of the code editor, pending time. Eventually, this may get to a point
where after X amount of time has passed the stored code from a group session will delete itself forever.
